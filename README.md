TASK 6
NOTE : FOR THIS TASK  AT EVRY POINT I USED GOOGLE GEMINI WHICH IS IN BUILT AI IN GOOGLE COLAB AS I'M NOT VERY MUCH GOOD AT THESE TASKS
STEP 1 : Loaded the data and removed the id col as it does not effect the results
STEP 2 : As we are using KNN it compares distances, so we make sure that all features are fair and are on the same scale .
STEP 3 : Splitting of data into training and testing.
STEP 4 : Training KNN classifier where we use 3 neighbours for model to compare and predict the new one  .
STEP 5 : Using sklearn.metrices we start our predictions and see the accuracy rate.
STEP 6 : In this step we give different neighbours for the model to predict and see for which it gives the best results .
STEP 7 : EVALUATIONS AND VISUVALIZATIONS
